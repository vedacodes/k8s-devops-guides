# Troubleshooting Kubernetes

Checklist:
- Check pod status, events, and describe failing pods.
- Inspect kubelet, control-plane, and API server logs.
- Validate network policies, DNS, and image pulls.
- Use kubectl-debug, ephemeralsidecar, and port-forward for live debugging.

Keep runbooks for common incidents and postmortems for learning.
